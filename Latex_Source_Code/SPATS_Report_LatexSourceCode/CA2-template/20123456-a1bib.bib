abstract = {Fog computing refers to cloud computing development to the edge of a corporate network. Fog computing, as a promising computing paradigm, facilitates computing, storing and network services between terminal devices and cloud computing data centers. It also brings many advantages to cloud computing and large-scale deployment of IoT applications such as low latency, data locality, location-awareness, mobility, less computational cost and geographical distribution. This extensive range of functionality raises various security concerns related to data, virtualization, segregation, network communication and monitoring. Security is a significant issue for fog computing since fog-based services are offered to massive-scale end-users by front fog nodes/servers. Also, fog computing focuses on ensuring the availability and reliability of services without worrying about the information stored or processed by the fog. Despite significant efforts that have been made in this field, many issues are still open. This paper prepares a comprehensive study of security challenges and different approaches in fog computing to address those challenges using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. Moreover, a technical taxonomy is offered for the fog security challenges and their strategies in terms of six aspects, including reliability, access control, attacks, secure connection, privacy and some special cases. The core objective of this study is to analytically and statistically classify the existing research techniques related to security aspects and available solutions in fog computing published between 2014 and 2021. Then some technical questions in this domain are provided, and also the strengths and weaknesses of each indicated fog security approach are discussed based on the questions, as well as suggesting some ideas to address security deficiencies in fog computing. Finally, some future motivational directions and open issues in this field are provided to design, implement, and maintain fog systems.}

abstract = {With the increasing advancement in the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), the integrated Cloud Computing (CC) faces numerous threats such as performance, security, latency, and network breakdown. With the discovery of Fog Computing these issues are addressed by taking CC nearer to the Internet of Things (IoT). The key functionality of the fog is to provide the data generated by the IoT devices near the edge. Processing of the data and data storage is done locally at the fog node rather than moving the information to the cloud server. In comparison with the cloud, Fog Computing delivers services with high quality and quick response time. Hence, Fog Computing might be the optimal option to allow the Internet of Things to deliver an efficient and highly secured service to numerous IoT clients. It allows the administration of the services and resource provisioning outside CC, nearer to devices, at the network edge, or ultimately at places specified by Service Level Agreements (SLA’s). Fog Computing is not a replacement to CC, but a prevailing component. It allows the processing of the information at the edge though still delivering the option to connect with the data center of the cloud. In this paper, we put forward various computing paradigms, features of fog computing, an in-depth reference architecture of fog with its various levels, a detailed analysis of fog with IoT, various fog system algorithms and also systematically examine the challenges in Fog Computing which acts as a middle layer between IoT sensors or devices and data centers of the cloud.}

abstract = {Optimization is an inseparable part of Cloud computing, particularly with the emergence of Fog and Edge paradigms. Not only these emerging paradigms demand reevaluating cloud-native optimizations and exploring Fog and Edge-based solutions, but also the objectives require significant shift from considering only latency to energy, security, reliability and cost. Hence, it is apparent that optimization objectives have become diverse and lately Internet of Things (IoT)-specific born objectives must come into play. This is critical as incorrect selection of metrics can mislead the developer about the real performance. For instance, a latency-aware auto-scaler must be evaluated through latency-related metrics as response time or tail latency; otherwise the resource manager is not carefully evaluated even if it can reduce the cost. Given such challenges, researchers and developers are struggling to explore and utilize the right metrics to evaluate the performance of optimization techniques such as task scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource scheduling and resource execution. This is challenging due to (1) novel and multi-layered computing paradigm, e.g., Cloud, Fog and Edge, (2) IoT applications with different requirements, e.g., latency or privacy, and (3) not having a benchmark and standard for the evaluation metrics. In this paper, by exploring the literature, (1) we present a taxonomy of the various real-world metrics to evaluate the performance of cloud, fog, and edge computing; (2) we survey the literature to recognize common metrics and their applications; and (3) outline open issues for future research. This comprehensive benchmark study can significantly assist developers and researchers to evaluate performance under realistic metrics and standards to ensure their objectives will be achieved in the production environments.}

abstract = {Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.}

abstract = {In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant increase in the number of elderly who often suffer from chronic diseases, and has witnessed in recent months a major spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), which has led to thousands of deaths, especially among the elderly and people who suffer from chronic diseases. Coronavirus has also caused many problems in hospitals, where these are no longer able to accommodate a large number of patients. This virus has also begun to spread between medical and paramedical teams, and this causes a major risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals. To reduce the spread of the virus and maintain the health of patients who need a hospital stay, home hospitalization is one of the best possible solutions. This paper proposes a home hospitalization system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog computing, and Cloud computing, which are among the most important technologies that have contributed to the development of the healthcare sector in a significant way. These systems allow patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and among their families, where patient health and the hospitalization room environmental state are monitored, to enable doctors to follow the hospitalization process and make recommendations to patients and their supervisors, through monitoring units and mobile applications developed for this purpose. The results of evaluation have shown great acceptance of this system by patients and doctors alike.}

Methods: The investigations were systematically performed on fog computing in the healthcare field by all studies; furthermore, the four databases Web of Science (WoS), ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Scopus from 2007 to 2017 were used to analyze their architecture, applications, and performance evaluation. Results: A total of 99 articles were selected on fog computing in healthcare applications with deferent methods and techniques depending on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The taxonomy results were divided into three major classes; frameworks and models, systems (implemented or architecture), review and survey. Discussion: Fog computing is considered suitable for the applications that require real-time, low latency, and high response time, especially in healthcare applications. All these studies demonstrate that resource sharing provides low latency, better scalability, distributed processing, better security, fault tolerance, and privacy in order to present better fog infrastructure. Learned lessons: numerous lessons related to fog computing. Fog computing without a doubt decreased latency in contrast to cloud computing. Researchers show that simulation and experimental proportions ensure substantial reductions of latency is provided. Which it is very important for healthcare IoT systems due to real-time requirements. Conclusion: Research domains on fog computing in healthcare applications differ, yet they are equally important for the most parts. We conclude that this review will help accentuating research capabilities and consequently expanding and making extra research domains.}

abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

abstract = {By using fog computing, cloud computing can be extended to the edge of the network. Generally, in the public cloud, fog computing comprises three components: terminal device, fog node and public cloud server (PCS). In this paper, we propose the concept of anonymous and secure aggregation scheme (ASAS) in fog-based public cloud computing. In the ASAS model, a fog node aggregates the data from terminal nodes and forwards the aggregated data to the public cloud server. By using the ASAS scheme, the fog node can help terminal devices upload their data to PCS. By using the data aggregation technique, our ASAS scheme can save bandwidth between the fog node and PCS. At the same time, our ASAS scheme not only protects the identities of terminal devices by using pseudonyms but it also guarantees data secrecy via a homomorphic encryption technique. In this paper, we design the first concrete ASAS scheme. We also examine the security and the performance of our proposal, which we show to be provably secure and efficient.}
